# 🎯 Quiz App - React Project

The **Quiz App** is an interactive and dynamic quiz application developed using **React.js**. This app provides an engaging and user-friendly experience by fetching quiz data from a remote API and displaying it to the user. The user is guided through a series of questions one by one, and can navigate between them using the **"Next"** button. 

The app allows the user to answer multiple-choice questions with options and tracks the progression of the quiz. It's designed to help beginners and intermediate developers understand how to work with React, state management, and data fetching from an API. 

With features like asynchronous API fetching, navigation through questions, and dynamic rendering based on state, this project provides a great foundation to build more complex quiz applications.
